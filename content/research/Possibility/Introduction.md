# Research Questions

- Children with ASD seem more rational in some tasks than the Typical developing controls (Rozenkrantz et al., 2021). Is it possible that ASD is also more rational in the "matching-maximize" task (Fantino & Esfandiari, 2002, West & Stanovich, 2003)? 
- Whether Children with ASD can simultaneously represent the two mutually exclusive possibilities (Redshaw & Suddendorf, 2016)?
- **!!!!NOTE!!!!**: What is the relation between the two tasks ?
