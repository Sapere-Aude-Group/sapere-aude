# The logic behind the experiment

Theory of mind, especially the performance as being measured by the "false-belief task", is traditionally regarded as an advanced ability that is unique to human older than 4 years old (REF). Non-human primates and human children younger than 3 years' old lack such ability.

New experimental techniques, however, tell a different story:
